## Structure

This organization contains the applications we used to evaluate [Fontus](https://github.com/SAP/project-fontus) for enforcing GDPR properties in applications. They can serve as a testing ground if you are interested in Fontus and provide some hopefully useful hints on how to configure Fontus based on real applications.
